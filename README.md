# Telecom-Churn-Analysis

Steps Involved In the Project :-

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected the raw data from the telecom company's database and preprocess it using Python. Data cleaning and feature engineering techniques applied to ensure the data is in the desired format for analysis.

# üßπ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning:

Conducted EDA on the preprocessed data using Python. This step includes performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

# ‚öíÔ∏èData Modeling:

Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, and random forest. This step will helped to identify the key features that contribute to telecom churn and how they interact with each other.
